                <h3>
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically
                    associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and
                    decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and
                    software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to
                    take
                    actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.

                    High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search);
                    recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google
                    Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g.,
                    ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).
                    However,
                    many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general
                    applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common
                    enough it's not labeled AI anymore."<br>
                    Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular
                    tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation,
                    planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these
                    goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and
                    mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on
                    statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics,
                    philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and
                    Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any
                    cognitive task at least as well as a human.[5]

                    Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through
                    multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and
                    loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when
                    graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning
                    outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the
                    transformer architecture.[12] In the 2020s,
